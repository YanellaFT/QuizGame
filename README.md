# PyGames
This is a collection of mini games, quizes, and conversion tools. 
Users can choose options and participate in interctive games, quizes, and conversions. 

I did this project to expand my python skills as it is a new language for me. Each game features a more advanced tool, like if statements, arrays or for loops. The most challenging part was being able to get the Roman Numeral Converter working. It took me many days to get it working, and it was very satisfying to finally have it done!
